* Simple Colors

|String|Purpose|
| ---------------- |:-----------------------:|
| accent | all of the new branding colors, example: bot tags |
| background | alot of main colors |
| background_secondary | alot of secondary colors |
| mention_highlight | changes the background color when you get mentioned |
| active_channel | currently this does not seem to theme anything |
| status bar | changes the color of the status bar on your device |
| input_background | color of user notes background, search boxes, magnify icon, channel name and topic, and role name when creating a new role. | 
> Note: input_background seems to have problems on some devices, I am up to date and using Android 11 but input_background themes nothing.
